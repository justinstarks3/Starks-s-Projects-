    "In this notebook, I aim to create a recommendation system for TV series and Movies from this dataset. Machine Learning plays a crucial role in creating recommendation systems. Recommendation systems are used by many online platforms such as e-commerce websites, streaming services, social media platforms, and more to suggest items, products, movies, music, or content to users based on their preferences, behaviors, and patterns. In this notebook I am going to attempt to use collaborative filtering and user-entertainment interaction to find patterns and make predictions."

The dataset was created using public information from Netflix, using a web scrapper. Furthermore, as Netflix is constantly adapating and evolving, it's really unlikely that this dataset would include EVERY observations, so there are some limitations in this specific area. Because of this, the dataset could affect the reliability and generalizability of the findings. However, this dataset is still useful in analyzing the available data for stakeholders and strategies to keep viewers engaged creating the best possible outcomes for Netflix and it's shareholders!\n"

    "This analysis has provided valuable insights into the trends and patterns of Netflix content based on genre and descriptive metadata. By leveraging techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, we were able to discern distinct preferences and trends that shape viewer recommendations. The findings suggest that certain genres and descriptors are more prevalently recommended, influenced by their representation and viewer popularity within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our study underscores the significance of sophisticated metadata handling and analysis in enhancing content recommendation systems. For stakeholders, including content curators and platform engineers, these insights can guide more nuanced content strategies and algorithm refinements. This could lead to a more engaging user experience, where recommendations are both more accurate and reflective of diverse viewer preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward, further research could expand on this foundational work by incorporating additional metadata layers and exploring temporal changes in viewer behavior and content popularity. Such efforts would continue to refine our understanding of digital content consumption and the dynamic landscape of streaming platforms."
