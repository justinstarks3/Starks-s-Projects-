The dataset was created using public information from Netflix, using a web scrapper. Furthermore, as Netflix is constantly adapating and evolving, it's really unlikely that this dataset would include EVERY observations, so there are some limitations in this specific area. Because of this, the dataset could affect the reliability and generalizability of the findings. However, this dataset is still useful in analyzing the available data for stakeholders and strategies to keep viewers engaged creating the best possible outcomes for Netflix and it's shareholders!\n"
