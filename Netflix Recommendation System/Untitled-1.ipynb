Recommendation systems are used by many online platforms such as e-commerce websites, streaming services, social media platforms, and more to suggest items, products, movies, music, or content to users based on their preferences, behaviors, and patterns. In this notebook I am going to attempt to use collaborative filtering and user-entertainment interaction to find patterns and make predictions."

The dataset was created using public information from Netflix, using a web scrapper. Furthermore, as Netflix is constantly adapating and evolving, it's really unlikely that this dataset would include EVERY observations, so there are some limitations in this specific area. Because of this, the dataset could affect the reliability and generalizability of the findings.
